		<h1>Mindfulness</h1><!--shortcut by "Tab" or "Enter"-->
			<p style="margin-top: 20px; color: purple; border: 3px solid black">Mindfulness is a state of active, open attention on the present. When you're mindful, you observe your thoughts and feelings from a distance, without judging them good or bad. Instead of letting your life pass you by, mindfulness means living in the moment and awakening to experience.</p>

					<li>Write down everything that's on your mind on one piece of paper (use more than one piece if you need).</li>
					<li>Create three columns on a second piece of paper, and label them: To Be Done; Maybe Later; and Delete. Sort all the items on the first piece of paper into the three columns on the second piece of paper.</li>
					<li>Take each item from the Delete column, send it off into space, and tell it never to return (with a corny little ceremony if that helps).</li>
					<li>Take the items from the Maybe Later column and put them on a Maybe Later list. (If you don't keep one, start one).</li>
					<li>Take the items from the To Be Done column and put them into your planning system. (If you don't have a planning system, get one).</li>
				</ol>
