				<p>I'm currently editing my Learn Ruby The Hard Way book and cleaning some things up here and there. In the process I've stumbled on what Rubyists call an "idiom", the use of .each to do loops instead of a for-loop. To them this is one of the most important signs that you are a real Ruby programmer. They look at this usage of one looping construct over another as some sign that you are incompetent, and haven't been properly indoctrinated into the Ruby community's ways. It's not just Ruby. Python, Java, every language has these weird "idioms" that denote your acceptance of their community standards. I'm just using Ruby's .each since it seems to be one of the most arbitrary yet vehemently demanded code constructs out there.

				<h3>If Not Idioms Then What?</h3>

				<p>If these things we're calling idioms are nearly required, and people are judged for not using them, then they can't be idioms. Based on the crazy amount of yelling I receive over and over again from people in the Ruby community over something as incredibly minor as .each vs. a for-loop, I can tell you these are definitely not idioms. There has to be another word for what these are, and that word is "mores".</p>
